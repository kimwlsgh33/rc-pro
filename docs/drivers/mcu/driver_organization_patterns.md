# Driver Organization Patterns

This document analyzes and compares different driver organization patterns in the codebase, using the Timer and Motor drivers as case studies. The goal is to establish best practices for driver organization in our embedded system.

## Case Study: Timer vs Motor Driver Organization

### Timer Driver (Exemplary Pattern)
Located in `src/drivers/mcu/timer/`

#### Architecture
1. **Clear Layered Structure**
   - Common Layer (`drv_timer_common.h`): Base types and interfaces
   - Generic Interface (`drv_timer.h`): Hardware-independent API
   - Implementation Layer (`drv_timer.c`): Core functionality
   - Hardware-Specific Layer (`drv_timer1.c`): MCU-specific code

2. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README.md with architecture overview
   - Clear usage examples
   - Well-documented interfaces

3. **Interface Design**
   - Clean Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
   - Well-defined operation interfaces
   - Consistent error handling patterns

### Motor Driver (Current Pattern)
Located in `src/drivers/motor/`

#### Architecture
1. **Mixed Structure**
   - Common definitions (`drv_motor_common.h`)
   - Direct implementations (`drv_motor_a.c`, `drv_motor_b.c`)
   - Hardware specifics mixed with business logic

2. **Documentation**
   - Limited inline documentation
   - No centralized architecture documentation
   - Missing usage examples

3. **Interface Design**
   - Basic interface in common header
   - Partial hardware abstraction
   - Some layer coupling present

## Recommended Best Practices

### 1. Directory Structure
```
driver_name/
├── common/
│   └── drv_name_common.h       # Common definitions
├── hal/
│   ├── drv_name_hal.h         # Hardware abstraction interface
│   └── drv_name_hal_avr.c     # MCU-specific implementation
├── core/
│   └── drv_name.c             # Core driver logic
└── implementations/
    └── drv_name_specific.c    # Specific implementations
```

### 2. Documentation Requirements
- README.md with:
  - Architecture overview
  - Layer responsibilities
  - Configuration guidelines
  - Usage examples
  - Error handling patterns

### 3. Interface Design
- Clear separation between:
  - Hardware abstraction (HAL)
  - Core logic
  - Implementation specifics
- Consistent error handling
- Well-defined configuration structures
- Clear initialization sequence

### 4. Code Organization
- Separate configuration validation
- Centralized error definitions
- Clean interface boundaries
- Minimal inter-layer dependencies
- Hardware-specific code isolation

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Creating New Drivers
- Start with common definitions
- Define HAL interface before implementation
- Document architecture decisions
- Include usage examples

### 2. Refactoring Existing Drivers
- Identify and separate layers
- Move hardware-specific code to HAL
- Add missing documentation
- Standardize error handling
- Add configuration validation

### 3. Testing Considerations
- Unit test support
- Mock HAL interfaces
- Error injection capabilities
- Configuration validation tests

## Conclusion

The Timer driver demonstrates a well-organized pattern that should be followed for new drivers and used as a reference for refactoring existing ones. This pattern promotes:

- Code maintainability
- Hardware independence
- Clear documentation
- Consistent interfaces
- Testability

Following these patterns will improve code quality, reduce maintenance effort, and make the codebase more approachable for new developers.
