# DO NOT CAST TO void*
In this case, you should NOT cast error_history to (void*). This is different from the memset case for several important reasons:

1. Here you're directly accessing a member of the volatile structure (history[error_history.current_index]). The volatile qualifier is important because it ensures proper synchronization when accessing the error history from different contexts (like interrupts).

2. The line error_record_t *record = &error_history.history[error_history.current_index]; is correctly getting the address of an array element, and the volatile semantics should be preserved here since this data could be modified by interrupt handlers.

3. Unlike memset which is a temporary operation protected by ATOMIC_BLOCK, this is creating a pointer that will be used to modify the record's fields. We want to maintain the volatile semantics for these modifications.

# Error Codes Volatile Pointer Handling

## Important Considerations

1. **DO NOT cast volatile pointers to void***
   - In `error_record()`, the line `error_record_t *record = &error_history.history[error_history.current_index]` must maintain its volatile qualifier
   - Casting to `void*` would remove important volatile semantics needed for interrupt safety

2. **Use volatile qualifiers for function returns**
   - Functions that return pointers to volatile data (like `error_get_history()`) should include the volatile qualifier in their return type
   - This ensures callers handle the data correctly and don't make incorrect assumptions about caching or optimization

3. **Exceptions for atomic operations**
   - When using `memset()` on volatile data, it's safe to cast to `void*` if:
     - The operation is protected by `ATOMIC_BLOCK`
     - The operation is temporary and completes quickly
     - The volatile semantics are not needed for the duration of the operation

## Examples

### Correct Usage:
```c
// Safe because it's in an atomic block and temporary
ATOMIC_BLOCK(ATOMIC_RESTORESTATE) {
    memset((void *)&error_history, 0, sizeof(error_history_t));
}

// Maintains volatile semantics for ongoing pointer usage
error_record_t *record = &error_history.history[error_history.current_index];

// Correctly propagates volatile qualifier to callers
volatile error_history_t *error_get_history(void);
```

### Incorrect Usage:
```c
// WRONG: Loses volatile semantics for ongoing pointer usage
error_record_t *record = (void *)&error_history.history[error_history.current_index];

// WRONG: Caller won't know data is volatile
error_history_t *error_get_history(void);
